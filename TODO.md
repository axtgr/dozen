- Tests.
- Error handling.
- Config extension via a property (e.g. `{ extends: '../configs/base.json' }`).
- Per-entry cache. When an entry with an existing id is emitted by a source, only this entry should be processed, and then the config should be rebuilt using all the processed (cached and new) entries.
- Watching for changes.
- React integration.
- Smart merging. Implement a reducer that deeply merges configs while concatenating arrays.
- Make sure the order of entries between the processed and unprocessed ones is preserved.
- JSDoc.
- If a parent entry changes its order, should the child entries be reordered as well?
- Use a meta object instead of tags.
